# CSS Essentials

A comprehensive guide and playground for mastering modern CSS, including selectors, layout methods, animations, variables, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help web developers of all levels learn and experiment with essential CSS concepts. Each section demonstrates a different aspect of CSS, with live examples and organized code for hands-on learning.

### Features

- **Fundamental and advanced CSS selectors**
- **CSS variables and global styles**
- **Modern layout techniques:** Flexbox, CSS Grid, and more
- **CSS animations and transitions**
- **Best practices and reusable patterns**

## Project Structure

```
CSS-Essentials/
  index.html
  style.css
  script.js
  css/
  [topic folders]/
```

Each topic folder (like `flexbox-mastery/`, `css-grid/`, etc.) contains focused examples and code for that CSS concept.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prynixdevs/CSS-Essentials.git
cd CSS-Essentials
```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to explore the main page and navigate to different CSS topics.

## How to Learn from This Code

Explore each folder and open the corresponding HTML and CSS files to see real examples of CSS concepts in action. Start with `index.html` for an overview, then dive into:

- Themed folders (like `flexbox-mastery/`, `css-grid/`, `animations/`) for focused topics
- The `css/` directory for all the main stylesheets
- Try editing the code and refreshing your browser to see changes live

Each section is designed to be simple and practical, so you can copy code, experiment, and quickly understand how modern CSS works.

---

- Keep your code clean and well-commented.
- Follow the existing folder and file structure.
- Add clear descriptions to your Pull Requests.
- If adding new CSS topics, create a new folder and corresponding CSS file if needed.
